I want you to build a fully functional, professional, and production-style HR Management System web application using Python (Flask) and MySQL, fully runnable on Replit.

The web app should be modern, responsive, and visually appealing — designed like a real corporate system with clear navigation, elegant dashboards, consistent layouts, and a professional Crimson (#DC143C) color palette. The entire project must be coded in Python using Flask and follow clean folder structuring, modular code, and proper comments.

Core Requirements

The system should have two main user roles:

HR

Recruiter

Additionally, include a registration page so that both HR and Recruiter can create accounts before logging in.

The website must include:

A Login page and Registration page with form validation and password hashing (Flask-Bcrypt).

A Dashboard for each role (HR and Recruiter) with intuitive navigation and dynamic content.

HR Module for managing student records, uploading resumes, viewing analytics, and handling recruiter requests.

Recruiter Module for posting job requirements, viewing ranked candidates, and sending notifications.

HR Module Features

Login and registration with secure authentication.

Dashboard showing quick stats and analytics charts.

Manage student records:

Add, update, delete, and view students.

Fields: Name, Branch, GPA, Email, Phone, and Skills.

Upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) stored in an /uploads folder with secure validation.

View all recruiter job requests.

Analytics dashboard using Chart.js displaying:

Average GPA of shortlisted students.

Number of students per branch.

Top 5 most common skills.

Option to export shortlisted students as a CSV or Excel file.

View notifications when a recruiter posts a new job.

Recruiter Module Features

Login and registration with authentication.

Post new job requirements (skills, branch preference, GPA threshold, description).

Automatically trigger notifications to HR when a job is posted.

View a ranked shortlist of students based on AI Fit Scores.

Select students from the list to send automatic email notifications.

AI Ranking System

Use an AI-based Fit Score (0–100) to rank students for each job request.

Weighted criteria:

Skill match: 50%

GPA threshold: 30%

Branch relevance: 20%

Implement using the Sentence-BERT MiniLM model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) from the sentence-transformers library.

The AI should calculate similarity between recruiter job descriptions and student skills or resumes, then generate a ranked list in descending order.

Email Notification System

Use Flask-Mail with SMTP integration (Gmail or other services) to automatically send emails to shortlisted students.

Use environment variables for credentials (MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD, etc.).

Email template example:

Subject: Shortlist Notification – [Company]
Dear [Student Name],
Congratulations! You have been shortlisted for the role posted by [Company]. Please wait for further instructions.

Frontend and Design

The website should have a modern, professional UI:

Use Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout.

Use Crimson (#DC143C) as the primary color for buttons, headers, and highlights.

Include well-structured navigation bars, side menus, and cards for displaying information.

Ensure consistent spacing, padding, and clean typography.

Add relevant icons using FontAwesome or Lucide for visual clarity.

Include a clean, well-designed homepage with branding and a short tagline like “Smart Recruitment, Simplified.”

Every page should have a clear header, footer, and proper structure.

Ensure both dashboards (HR and Recruiter) are filled with useful widgets, charts, and data tables.

Database Design (MySQL)

Create SQL tables:

Users – (user_id, username, email, password, role {HR, Recruiter})

Student – (student_id, name, branch, gpa, email, phone, skills)

Resume – (resume_id, student_id, resume_file)

Job_Request – (job_id, recruiter_id, required_skills, min_gpa, branch_pref, description, created_at)

Shortlist – (shortlist_id, job_id, student_id, fit_score, status {Shortlisted, Selected, Rejected})

Notifications – (notif_id, recruiter_id, message, created_at)

Include SQL relationships and foreign keys. Provide the schema.sql file with sample data.
